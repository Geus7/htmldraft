<h1><i>Deployment Models</h1></i>
<h2>There are four types of Deployment models:</h2>
<b>
<ol>
<li>Public Cloud</li>
<li>Private Cloud</li>
<li>Community Cloud</li>
<li>Hybrid Cloud</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
<h2>Public Model</h2>
<p>As its names suggest, the public cloud is available to the general public, and resources are shared
between all users. They are available to anyone, from anywhere, using the Internet. The public cloud
deployment model is one of the most popular types of cloud.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/3/cloud-deployment-models.png" alt="Public cloud model" class="center" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

<p>This computing model is hosted at the vendor’s data center. The public cloud model makes the resources,
such as storage and applications, available to the public over the WWW. It serves all the requests;
therefore, resources are almost infinite.

Characteristics of Public Cloud
Here are the essential characteristics of the Public Cloud:
 
Uniformly designed Infrastructure Works on the Pay-as-you-go basis Economies of scale
SLA guarantees that all users have a fair share with no priority
It is a multitenancy architecture, so data is highly likely to be leaked.
</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Private Cloud</h2>
<h3>
The private cloud deployment model is a dedicated environment for one user or customer.
You don’t share
the hardware with any other users, as all the hardware is yours.

It is a one-to-one environment for single use, so there is no need to share your hardware with anyone
else. The main difference between private and public cloud deployment models is how you handle the
hardware. It is also referred to as “internal cloud,” which refers to the ability to access systems and
services within an organization or border.

<h2>Community Cloud</h2>
<p>Community clouds are cloud-based infrastructure models that enable multiple organizations to share resources
and services based on standard regulatory requirements. It provides a shared platform and resources for
organizations to work on their business requirements. This Cloud Computing model is operated and managed by
community members, third-party vendors, or both. The organizations that share standard business requirements
make up the members of the community cloud.</p>

<h2>Hybrid Cloud</h2>
<p>
A hybrid cloud deployment model combines public and private clouds. Creating a hybrid cloud computing model
means that a company uses the public cloud but owns on-premises systems and provides a connection between
the two. They work as one system, which is a beneficial model for a smooth transition into the public cloud
over an extended period.

Some companies cannot operate solely in the public cloud because of security concerns or data protection
requirements. So, they may select the hybrid cloud to combine the requirements with the benefits of a public
cloud. It enables on-premises applications with sensitive data to run alongside public cloud applications.

<h2></h2>
<h2><i>Service Models of Cloud Computing</i></h2>
<ol>
<li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</li>
<li>Software as a Service (SaaS)</li>
<li>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</li>
</ol>
<h2>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h2>
<p>aaS is also known as Hardware as a Service (HaaS). It is a computing infrastructure managed over the
internet. The main advantage of using IaaS is that it helps users to avoid the cost and complexity of
purchasing and managing the physical servers.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of PaaS</h3>
<ol>
<li>sources are available as a service</li>
<li>Services are highly scalable</li>
<li>Dynamic and flexible</li>
<li>GUI and API-based access</li>
<li>Automated administrative tasks</li>
</ol>
<h3>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h3>
<p>SaaS is also known as "on-demand software". It is a software in which the applications are hosted by a cloud service provider. Users can access these applications with the help of internet connection and web browser.

</p>
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/3/cloud-service-model-2.png" alt="Saas" class="center" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
<h3>Characteristics of SaaS</h3>
<ol>
<li>Managed from a central location</li>
<li>Hosted on a remote server</li>
<li>Accessible over the internet</li>
<li>Users are not responsible for hardware and software updates. Updates are applied automatically.</li>
<li>The services are purchased on the pay-as-per-use basis</li>
</ol>
<h3>Platform as a Service (PaaS)</h3>
<p>PaaS cloud computing platform is created for the programmer to develop, test, run, and manage the applications.</p>
<img src="https://www.guru99.com/images/3/cloud-service-models-3.webp" alt="Paas" class="center" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" >
<h3>Characteristis of PaaS</h3>
<ol>
<li>Accessible to various users via the same development application.</li>
<li>Integrates with web services and databases.</li>
<li>Builds on virtualization technology, so resources can easily be scaled up or down as per the organization's need.</li>
 
<li> Support multiple languages and frameworks.</li>
<li>Provides an ability to "Auto-scale".</li>
</ol>
